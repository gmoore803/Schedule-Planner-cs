## Schedule Planner Program

CS230**

-	The beginning portion of my code prints the text welcoming the user to my schedule planner simulation
-	I used the print function to shape the welcome page of my project.
-	I took input from the user and stored them into variables called name and name2 from there I used this variable in the rest of the project to get the name.
-	I listed the courses in a selection and took user input for the course selection and stored in inside a list called “inputs”
-	After taking the users selection of the desired amount of courses my program creates a text file to store the users name and input data from the program.
